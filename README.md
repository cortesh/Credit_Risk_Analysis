# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

### Evaluating Credit Worthiness
Determining credit worthiness has inherent problems as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  It will, therefore, be necessary to deploy various techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

### Project Task
imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries will be used to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the following models will be applied:
* RandomOverSampler
* SMOTE algorithms
* ClusterCentroids algorithm
* SMOTEENN algorithm
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier
* EasyEnsembleClassifier
